# Outlier-Robust Optimal Transport

Code for robust GAN experiments in "Outlier-Robust Optimal Transport: Duality, Structure, and Statistical Analysis" and its follow-up work "Robust Estimation under the Wasserstein Distance" by Sloan Nietert, Rachel Cummings, and Ziv Goldfeld. WGAN-GP code is modified from [this implementation](https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp), StyleGAN 2 code is modified from [this implementation](https://nn.labml.ai/gan/stylegan/index.html), and CIFAR code is modified from [this implementation](https://github.com/yogeshbalaji/robustOT).
